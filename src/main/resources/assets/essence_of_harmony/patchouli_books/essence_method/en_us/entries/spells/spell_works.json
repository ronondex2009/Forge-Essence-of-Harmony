        "When a player plays a sequence of notes associated with a motif, that motif will execute ONLY IF:$(li) The correct symbols are aon the top of the stack, $(li) the instrument is capable of casting that motif, and $(li) the motif's own checks are valid.",
        "$(l:essence_of_harmony:motifs_category)Motifs$(/l) are divided into three categories: $(li) Spells, which can take in symbols and interacts with the world, $(li) Operators, which only interact with the stack and it's symbols, or $(li) Miscellaneous, which don't typically interact with the stack.",
        "Motifs can be casted by playing Z, X, C, V, B, N, and M keys which represent the C, D, E, F, G, A, and B notes respectively. $(br)$(4)NOTE: keybinds will conflict with other mods if present. There is no way to fix this, so please rebind them!"
